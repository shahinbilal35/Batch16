Async Apex
    - Running behind the scenes.
    - 4 types.
        - future, batch, queueable, schedulable

Future
    - @future -- annotate method with this annotation
    - static. 
    - void only (nothing returns)
    - parameters? 
        - no sObject. No list<sObject>
        - only primitive, or collection of primitive datatype
        how many parameters we can have in future method? (trick)
            - any number
            - ideal is less than 6 (for any method)
    - cannot call future method from future method (directly or indirectly)
        - inserting department
            - department Trigger
                - department handler future method
                    -insert employee
                        - Employee trigger execution
                            - calling another future method

Test Future
    - startTest and StopTest are mandatory.

Interface
    - What? methods in interface does not have any body (just method signature)
    - Method cannot be implemented in interface.
    - Class implements interfaces
        - the implemntor class MUST implement all the methods declared in interface.

Batch apex:
    - Why? why?
        - want to update huge number of records we use batch.
        - not only records, it can be any other limits
            - ex: 10k records to update max. 10 sec CPU time. 6 MB heap size
            - 50k update
                - write a batch. 5k record at once. 10 times batch execution.
            - 1000 records -> it is consuming 3 mins
                - Process 200 records at a time.
    - Database.batchabe is interface
            ex 
                 - 1000 records -> it is consuming 3 mins
                - Process 200 records at a time.
        - start
            - run only when batch starts. we do soql query here.
        - execute
            - 5 times execution. For each 200 records execute will execute.
                - if one of them fails, others can be successful.
                - new gov limits for each execution.
        - finish
            - executes at the end. Only Once.
